[Verse 1]
We praise Thee with our minds, O Lord
Kept sharp think Thy thought;
Come, Holy Ghost with grace outpoured,
To teach what Christ hath taught.

In all our learning may we seek
That wisdom from above
Which comes to all: the brave, the meek
Who ask in faith and love.

[Verse 2]
We praise Thee thro’ our bodies, Lord,
Kept strong to do Thy will;
Thy Spirit’s temples, which afford
A means to praise Thee still.

We give ourselves, a sacrifice,
To live as unto Thee;
For Thou alone hast paid the price
To bring salvation free.

[Verse 3]
We praise Thee in our hearts, O king,
Kept pure to know Thy ways;
And raise to Thee a hymn to sing
Eternally Thy praise.

Altho adoring hearts will bow
As age on ages roll;
We praise Thee in our beings now,
Mind, body, heart, and soul.
