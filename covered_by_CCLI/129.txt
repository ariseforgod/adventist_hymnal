[Verse 1]
As it fell upon a night
In the winter weather,
Angels bright in starry height
Began to sing together.

[Verse 2]
Shepherds sleeping on the plain
Woke to see the glory,
All amazed they stood and gazed
And heard the angels’ story.

[Verse 3]
Unto you a child is born
In a manger lowly,
Humble, He, yet born to be
The King of Love most holy.

[Verse 4]
Happy angels from afar,
Cease your singing never!
In excelsis gloria!
Forever and forever.
