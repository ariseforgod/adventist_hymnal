[Verse 1]
Like the woman at the well I was seeking
For things that could not satisfy:
And then I heard my Saviour speaking:
” Draw from my well that never shall run dry”.

[Chorus]
Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up, Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more–
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!

[Verse 2]
There are millions in this world who are craving
The pleasures earthly things afford;
But none can match the wondrous treasure
That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.

[Verse 3]
So, my brother, if the things this world gave you
Leave hungers that won’t pass away,
My blessed Lord will come and save you,
If you kneel to Him and humbly pray:
