Hymnal:78


[Verse 1]
For God so loved us,
He sent the Saviour:
For God so loved us,
and loves me too.

[Chorus]
Love so unending!
I’ll sing His praises,
God loves His children,
loves even me.

[Verse 2]
He sent the Saviour,
the blest Redeemer;
He sent the Saviour
to set me free.

[Verse 3]
He bade me welcome,
O word of mercy;
He bade me welcome,
O voice divine.

[Verse 4]
Glory and honour,
O Love eternal,
To Him be given
while life shall last.
