Hymnal:172

[Intro]
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

[Verse 1]
The strife is o’er, the battle done;
Now is the victor’s triumph won!
Now be the song of praise begun. Alleluia!

[Verse 2]
The pow’rs of death have done their worst,
But Christ their legions has dispersed.
Let shouts of holy joy outburst. Alleluia!

[Verse 3]
The three sad days have quickly sped,
He rises glorious from the dead.
All glory to our risen head! Alleluia!

[Verse 4]
Lord, by the stripes which wounded You,
From death’s sting free Your servants too,
That we may live and sing to You. Alleluia!
