Hymnal:66

[Verse 1]
God be with you till we meet again;
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you:
God be with you till we meet again.

[Verse 2]
God be with you till we meet again;
Neath His wings securely hide you,
Daily manna still provide you:
God be with you till we meet again.

[Verse 3]
God be with you till we meet again;
When life’s perils thick confound you,
Put His arms unfailing round you:
God be with you till we meet again.

[Verse 4]
God be with you till we meet again;
Keep love’s banner floating o’er you,
Smite death’s threatening wave before you:
God be with you till we meet again.
