Hymnal:569

[Verse 1]
Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
hear my humble cry;
while on others thou art calling,
do not pass me by.

[Chorus]
Saviour, Saviour, hear my humble cry;
while on others thou art calling,
do not pass me by.

[Verse 2]
Let me at thy throne of mercy
find a sweet relief,
kneeling there in deep contrition;
help my unbelief.

[Verse 3]
Trusting only in thy merit,
would I seek thy face;
heal my wounded, broken spirit,
save me by thy grace.

[Verse 4]
Thou the spring of all my comfort,
more than life to me,
whom have I on earth beside thee?
Whom in heaven but thee?
