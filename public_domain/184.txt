Hymnal:Hymn 184

[Verse 1]
I hear the Saviour say,
“Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.”

[Chorus]
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

[Verse 2]
Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone,
Can change the leper’s spots
And melt the heart of stone.

[Verse 3]
Since nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim,
I’ll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.

[Verse 4]
And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete,
I’ll lay my trophies down
All down at Jesus’ feet.
