Hymnal:587

[Verse 1]
In Christ there is no east nor west,
In Him no south or north;
But one great fellowship of love
Throughout the whole wide earth.

[Verse 2]
In Him shall true heart everywhere
Their high communion find;
His service is the golden cord
Close binding all mankind.

[Verse 3]
Join hands, then, brothers of the faith,
Whate’er your race may be.
Who serves my Father as a son
Is surely kin to me.

[Verse 4]
In Christ now meet both east and west,
In Him meet south and north;
All Christly souls are one in Him
Throughout the whole wide earth.
