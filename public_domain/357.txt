[Verse 1]
Come, labour on.
Who dares stand idle on the harvest plain
While all around him waves the golden grain?
And to each servant does the Master say,
“Go work today.”

[Verse 2]
Come, labour on.
Claim the high calling angels cannot share;
To young and old the gospel gladness bear;
Redeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly.
The night draws nigh.

[Verse 3]
Come, labour on.
No time for rest; till glows the western sky,
Till the long shadows o‘er our pathway lie,
And a glad sound comes with the setting sun,
“Well done, well done!”
