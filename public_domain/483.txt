Hymnal:483

[Verse 1]
I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord;
no tender voice like thine can peace afford.

[Chorus]
I need thee, O I need thee;
every hour I need thee;
O bless me now, my Saviour, I come to thee.

[Verse 2]
I need thee every hour; stay thou nearby;
temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.

[Verse 3]
I need thee every hour, in joy or pain;
come quickly and abide, or life is vain.

[Verse 4]
I need thee every hour; teach me thy will;
and thy rich promises in me fulfil.
