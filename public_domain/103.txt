Hymnal:103

[Verse 1]
O God, our help in ages past,
our hope for years to come,
our shelter from the stormy blast,
and our eternal home!

[Verse 2]
Under the shadow of thy throne,
still may we dwell secure;
sufficient is thine arm alone,
and our defence is sure.

[Verse 3]
Before the hills in order stood,
or earth received her frame,
from everlasting, thou art God,
to endless years the same.

[Verse 4]
A thousand ages, in thy sight,
are like an evening gone;
short as the watch that ends the night,
before the rising sun.

[Verse 5]
O God, our help in ages past,
our hope for years to come;
be thou our guide while life shall last,
and our eternal home!
