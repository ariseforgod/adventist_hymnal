Hymnal:26

[Verse 1]
Praise the Lord! you heavens, adore Him;
Praise Him, angels in the height;
Sun and moon, rejoice before Him,
Praise Him, all you stars of light.
Praise the Lord, for He has spoken;
World His mighty voice obeyed;
Laws which never shall be broken
For their guidance He has made.

[Verse 2]
Praise the Lord! for He is glorious;
Never shall HIs promise fail.
God has made His saints victorious;
Sin and death shall not prevail.
Praise the God of our salvation!
Hosts on high, His power proclaim;
Heaven and earth and all creation,
Laud and magnify His name.

[Verse 3]
Worship, honour, glory, blessing,
Lord, we offer as our gift.
Young and old, Your praise expressing,
Our glad songs to You we lift.
All the saints in heaven adore You,
We would join their glad acclaim;
As Your angels serve before You,
So on earth we praise Your name.
