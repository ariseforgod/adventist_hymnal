Hymnal:52

[Verse 1]
Now the day is over,
night is drawing nigh,
Shadows of the evening
steal across the sky.

[Verse 2]
Father, give the weary,
calm and sweet repose;
With Thy tenderest blessing
May our eyelids close.

[Verse 3]
Through the long night watches,
may thine angels spread
Their white wings above me,
watching round my bed.
