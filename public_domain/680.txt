Hymnal:680

[Verse 1]
Holy Spirit, hear us;
Help us while we sing;
Breath into the music
Of the praise we bring.

[Verse 2]
Holy Spirit, prompt us
When we kneel to pray;
Nearer come, and teach us
What we ought to say.

[Verse 3]
Holy Spirit, shine Thou
On the Book we read;
Gild it’s holy pages
With the light we need.
