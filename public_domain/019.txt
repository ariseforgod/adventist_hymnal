Hymnal:19

[Verse 1]
O sing a new song to the Lord
For marvels He has done;
His right hand and His holy arm
The victory have won.

[Verse 2]
With harp, and voice of psalms
Unto Jehovah sing;
Let trumpets and the echoing horn
Acclaim the Lord our King!

[Verse 3]
Let seas with all their creatures roar,
The world and dwellers there,
And let the rivers clap their hands,
The hills their joy declare.

[Verse 4]
Before the Lord: because He comes,
To judge the earth come He;
He’ll judge the world
with righteousness,
His folk with equity.
