Hymnal:254

[Verse 1]
The great Physician now is near,
The sympathising Jesus;
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
Oh! hear the voice of Jesus.

[Chorus]
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus.

[Verse 2]
Your many sins are all forgiven,
Oh! hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace to heaven,
And wear a crown with Jesus.

[Verse 3]
All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Saviour’s name,
I love the name of Jesus.

[Verse 4]
His name dispels my guilt and fear,
No other name but Jesus;
Oh! how my soul delights to hear
The charming name of Jesus.
