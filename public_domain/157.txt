[Verse 1]
Go to dark Gethsemane,
Ye who feel the tempter’s power
Your Redeemer’s conflict see.
Watch with him one bitter hour;
Turn not from his griefs away;
Learn from Jesus Christ to pray.

[Verse 2]
See Him at the judgment hall,
Beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;
See Him meekly bearing all;
Love to man His soul sustained!
Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
Learn from him to bear the cross.

[Verse 3]
Calvary’s mournful mountain climb;
There, adoring at his feet,
Mark that miracle of time,
God’s own sacrifice complete.
“It is finished!” hear him cry;
Learn from Jesus Christ to die.
