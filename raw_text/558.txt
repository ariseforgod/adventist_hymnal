558 – For the Fruits of His Creation


1
For the fruits of His creation, thanks be to God;
For the gifts to every nation, thanks be to God;
For the plowing, sowing, reaping,
Silent growth while men are sleeping,
Future needs in earth’s safe keeping, thanks be to God!

2
In the just reward of labor, God’s will is done;
In the hop we give our neighbor, God’s will is done;
In our worldwide take of caring
For the hungry and despairing,
In the harvests men are sharing, God’s will is done.

3
For the harvests of His Spirit, thanks be to God;
For the good all men inherit, thanks be to God;
For the wonders that astound us,
For the truths that still confound us,
Most of all, that love has found us, thanks be to God!
