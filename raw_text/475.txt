475 – Balm in Gilead


1
There is a balm in Gilead
To make the wounded whole;
There is a balm in Gilead
To heal the sin-sick soul.

2
Sometimes I feel discouraged,
And think my work’s in vain,
But then the Holy Spirit
Revives my soul again.

3
If you can not preach like Peter,
If you can not pray like Paul,
You can tell the love of Jesus,
And say He died for all.
