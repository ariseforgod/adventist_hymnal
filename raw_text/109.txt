Hymnal:109


[Verse 1]
Marvelous grace of our loving Lord.
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!
Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.

[Chorus]
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that is greater than all our sin!

[Verse 2]
Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold,
Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold
Points to the Refuge, the mighty Cross.

[Verse 3]
Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe!
You that are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive?
