312 – Near the Cross


1
Jesus, keep me near the cross;
there a precious fountain,
free to all, a healing stream,
flows from Calvary’s mountain.

Refrain
In the cross, in the cross,
be my glory ever,
till my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river.

2
Near the cross, a trembling soul,
love and mercy found me;
there the bright and morning star
sheds its beams around me.

3
Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
bring its scenes before me;
help me walk from day to day
with its shadow o’er me.

4
Near the cross I’ll watch and wait,
hoping, trusting ever,
till I reach the golden strand
