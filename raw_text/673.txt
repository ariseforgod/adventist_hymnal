673 – May God Be With You

May God be with you Till we meet again,
May God be with you, Keep you safe till then;
And may His blessings Be within your heart,
May God be with you While we’re apart,
May God be with you.

2
May God be with you, Watch you from above,
May God protect you in His tender love;
And with the dawning Of each bright, new day,
May God be with you, To guide your way,
May God be with you.
