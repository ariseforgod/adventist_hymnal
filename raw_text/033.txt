033 – Sing a New Song to the Lord


1
Sing a new song to the Lord,
He to whom wonders belong.
Rejoice in His triumph and tell of His power.
O sing a new song to the Lord.

2
Now to the ends of the earth
See His salvation is shown.
And still He remembers His mercy and truth,
Unchanging in love to His own.

3
Sing a new song and rejoice.
Publish His praises abroad.
Let voices in chorus with trumpet and horn,
Resound for the joy of the Lord.

4
Join with the hills and the sea,
Thunders of praise to prolong.
In judgement and justice
He comes to the earth
O sing a new song to the Lord.
