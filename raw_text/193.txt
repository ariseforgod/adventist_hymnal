193 – Savior, Teach Me


1
Saviour, teach me day by day,
Love’s sweet lesson to obey,
Sweeter lesson cannot be,
Loving Him who first loved me.

2
With a child’s glad heart of love,
At Thy bidding may I move,
Prompt to serve and follow Thee,
Loving Him who first loved me.

3
Teach me I am not my own,
I am Thine, and Thine alone;
Thine to keep, to rule, to save
From all sin that would enslave.

4
Love in loving finds employ,
In obedience all her joy;
Ever new that joy will be,
Loving Him who first loved me.

5
Teach me thus Thy steps to trace,
Strong to follow in Thy grace.
Learning how to love from Thee,
Loving Him who first loved me.
