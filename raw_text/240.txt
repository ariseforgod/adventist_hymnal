240 – Fairest Lord Jesus


1
Fairest Lord Jesus, ruler of all nature,
O thou of God and man the Son!
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor,
thou, my soul’s glory, joy, and crown.

2
Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands,
robed in the blooming garb of spring:
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer
who makes the woeful heart to sing.

3
Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight,
and all the twinkling starry host:
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
than all the angels heaven can boast.

4
Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations,
Son of God and Son of Man!
Glory and honor, praise, adoration,
now and forevermore be thine!
