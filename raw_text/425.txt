Hymnal:425


[Verse 1]
There is singing up in heaven
such as we have never known,
Where the angels sing the praises
of the Lamb upon the throne;

Their sweet harps are ever tuneful
and their voices are always clear,
O that we might be more like them
while we serve the Master here!

[Chorus]
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make
the courts of heaven ring;

But when I sing redemption’s story,
they will fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys
that our salvation brings.

[Verse 2]
But I hear another anthem,
blending voices clear and strong,
“Unto Him who hath redeemed us
and hath bought us,” is the song;

We have come thro’ tribulations
to this land so fair and bright,
In the fountain freely flowing
He hath made our garments white.

[Verse 3]
Then the angels stand and listen,
for they cannot join that song,
Like the sound of many waters,
by that happy, blood-washed throng;

For they sing about great trials,
battles fought and vict’ries won,
And they praised the great Redeemer,
who hath said to them, “Well done.”

[Verse 4]
So, although I’m not an angel,
yet I know that over there
I will join a blessed chorus
that the angels cannot share;

I will sing about my Saviour,
who upon dark Calvary
Freely pardoned my transgressions,
died to set the sinner free.
