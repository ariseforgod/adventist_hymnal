552 – The Lord's My Shepherd


1
The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want.
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

2
My soul He doth restore again.
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
E’en for His own name’s sake.

3
Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale,
Yet will I fear no ill,
For Thou art with me; and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

4
My table Thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes;
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.

5
Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me;
And in God’s house forevermore
My dwelling place shall be.
