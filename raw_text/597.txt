597 – Ye Servants of the Lord


1
Ye servants of the Lord,
Each in his office wait,
Observant of His heavenly Word,
And watchful at His gate.

2
Let all your lamps be bright,
And trim the golden flame,
Gird up your loins as in His sight,
His coming thus proclaim.

3
Watch, ’tis your Lord’s command,
And while we speak He’s near;
Mark the first signal of His hand,
And ready all appear.

4
O happy servant, he,
In such a posture found!
He shall His Lord with rapture see,
And be with honor crowned.
