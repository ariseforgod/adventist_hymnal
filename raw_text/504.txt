504 – Lord Jesus, Think on Me


1
Lord Jesus, think on me, And purge away my sin;
From earth-born passions set me free, And make me pure within.

2
Lord Jesus, think on me, With care and woe oppressed;
Let me Thy loving servant be, And taste Thy promised rest.

3
Lord Jesus, think on me, Nor let me go astray;
Through darkness and perplexity Point Thou the heavenly way.

4
Lord Jesus, think on me, That I may sing above
To Father, Spirit, and to Thee, The strains of praise and love.
