Hymnal:430

[Verse 1]
O there’ll be joy when the work is done,
Joy when the reapers gather home,
Bringing the sheaves at set of sun
To the New Jerusalem.

[Chorus]
Joy, joy, joy, there’ll be joy by and by,
Joy, joy, joy, where the joys never die;
Joy, joy, joy, for the day draweth nigh
When the workers gather home.

[Verse 2]
Sweet are the songs that we hope to sing,
Grateful the thanks our hearts shall bring,
Praising forever Christ our King
In the New Jerusalem.

[Verse 3]
Pure are the joys that await us there,
Many the golden mansions fair;
Jesus Himself doth them prepare,
In the New Jerusalem.
