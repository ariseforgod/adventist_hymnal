262 – Sweet, Sweet Spirit


1
There’s a sweet, sweet spirit in this place,
And I know that it’s the spirit of the Lord;
Sweet Holy Spirit,
Sweet Heavenly Dove,

2
Stay right here with us,
Filling us with Your love,
And for these blessings
We lift our hearts in praise,
Without a doubt we’ll know
That we have been revived
When we shall leave this place.

3
There are sweet expressions on each face,
And I know they feel the presence of the Lord.
Sweet Holy Spirit,
Sweet Heavenly Dove,

4
Stay right here with us,
Filling us with Your love,
And for these blessings
We lift our hearts in praise,
Without a doubt we’ll know
That we have been revived
When we shall leave this place.
