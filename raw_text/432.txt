Hymnal:432


[Verse 1]
Shall we gather at the river,
where bright angel feet have trod,
with its crystal tide forever
flowing by the throne of God?

[Chorus]
Yes, we’ll gather at the river,
the beautiful, the beautiful river;
gather with the saints at the river
that flows by the throne of God.

[Verse 2]
On the margin of the river,
washing up its silver spray,
we will walk and worship ever,
all the happy golden day.

[Verse 3]
Ere we reach the shining river,
lay we every burden down;
grace our spirits will deliver,
and provide a robe and crown.

[Verse 4]
Soon we’ll reach the shining river,
soon our pilgrimage will cease;
soon our happy hearts will quiver
with the melody of peace.
