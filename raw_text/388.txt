[Verse 1]
Don’t forget the Sabbath,
The Lord our God hath blest,
Of all the week the brightest,
Of all the week the best;
It brings repose from labor,
It tells of joy divine,
Its beams of light descending,
With heavenly beauty shine.

[Chorus]
Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,
Blessed Sabbath day,
Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,
Blessed Sabbath day.

[Verse 2]
Keep the Sabbath holy,
And worship Him today,
Who said to His disciples,
“I am the living way;”
And if we meekly follow
Our Savior here below,
He’ll give us of the fountain
Whose streams eternal flow.

[Verse 3]
Day of sacred pleasure!
Its golden hours we’ll spend
In thankful hymns to Jesus,
The children’s dearest Friend;
O gentle loving, Savior,
How good and kind Thou art,
How precious is Thy promise
To dwell in every heart!
