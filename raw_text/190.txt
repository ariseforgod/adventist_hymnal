[Verse 1]
Jesus loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but He is strong

[Chorus]
Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
The Bible tells me so.

[Verse 2]
Jesus loves me! He who died
Heaven’s gate to open wide:
He will wash away my sin,
Let His little child come in.

[Verse 3]
Jesus, take this heart of mine,
Make it pure and wholly thine;
On the cross You died for me,
I will love and live for Thee.
