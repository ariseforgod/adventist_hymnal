479 – Tread Softly


1
Be silent, be silent, A whisper is heard;
Be silent, and listen, Oh treasure each word.

Refrain
Tread softly, tread softly, The Master is here;
Tread softly here, tread softly here,
Tread softly, tread softly, He bids us draw near.
Tread softly here, tread softly here,

2
Be silent, be silent, For holy this place,
This altar that echoes The message of grace.

3
Be silent, be silent, Breathe humbly our prayer;
A foretaste of Eden This moment we share.

4
Be silent, be silent, His mercy record;
Be silent, be silent, And wait on the Lord.
