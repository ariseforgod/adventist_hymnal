Hymnal:160


[Verse 1]
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
Hark, all the tribes hosanna cry;
O Saviour meek, pursue Thy road
With palms and scattered garments strowed.

[Verse 2]
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
In lowly pomp ride on to die;
O Christ, Thy triumphs now begin
O’er captive death and conquered sin.

[Verse 3]
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
The winged squadrons of the sky
Look down with sad and wondering eyes
To see the approaching sacrifice.

[Verse 4]
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
In lowly pomp ride on to die;
Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain,
Then take, O God, Thy power and reign.
