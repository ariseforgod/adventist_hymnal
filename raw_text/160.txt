160 – Ride On in Majesty


1
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
Hark, all the tribes hosanna cry;
O Savior meek, pursue Thy road
With palms and scattered garments strowed.

2
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
In lowly pomp ride on to die;
O Christ, Thy triumphs now begin
O’er captive death and conquered sin.

3
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
The winged squadrons of the sky
Look down with sad and wondering eyes
To see the approaching sacrifice.

4
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
In lowly pomp ride on to die;
Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain,
Then take, O God, Thy power and reign.
