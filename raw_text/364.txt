364 – O Jesus Christ, to You


1
O Jesus Christ, to You may hymns be rising
In every city for Your love and care;
Inspire our worship, grant the glad surprising
That Your blest Spirit brings men everywhere.

2
Grant us new courage sacrificial humble
Strong in Your strength to venture and to dare,
To lift the fallen, guide the feet that stumble,
Seek out the lonely &amp;God’s mercy share

3
Show us Your Spirit, brooding oér each city,
As You did weep above Jerusalem,
Seeking to gather all in love and pity,
And healing those who touch Your garment’s hem.
