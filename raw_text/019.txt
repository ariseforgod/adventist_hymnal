019 – O Sing a New Song to the Lord


1
O sing a new song to the Lord
For marvels He has done;
His right hand and His holy arm
The victory have won.

2
With harp, and voice of psalms
Unto Jehovah sing;
Let trumpets and the echoing horn
Acclaim the Lord our King!

3
Let seas with all their creatures roar,
The world and dwellers there,
And let the rivers clap their hands,
The hills their joy declare.

4
Before the Lord: because He comes,
To judge the earth come He;
He’ll judge the world
with righteousness,
His folk with equity.
