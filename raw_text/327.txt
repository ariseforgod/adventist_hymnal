327 – I'd Rather Have Jesus


1
I’d rather have Jesus than silver or gold;
I’d rather be His than have riches untold;
I’d rather have Jesus than houses or land;
I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced hand:

Refrain
Than to be the king of a vast domain or be held in sin’s dread sway!
I’d rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.

2
I’d rather have Jesus than men’s applause;
I’d rather be faithful to His dear cause;
I’d rather have Jesus than world-wide fame;
I’d rather be true to His holy name:

3
He’s fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;
He’s sweeter than honey from out the comb;
He’s all that my hungering spirit needs –
I’d rather have Jesus and let Him lead:
