435 – The Glory Song


1
When all my labors and trails are o’er,
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
Just to be near the Lord I adore,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

Refrain
O that will be
O      that will
Glory for me, Glory for me,
Be    glory for me,    Glory for me,
Glory for me; When by His grace
Glory for me;
I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me.

2
When, by the gift of His infinite grace,
I am accorded in heaven a place,
Just to be there and to look on His face,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

3
Friends will be there I have loved long ago;
Joy like a river around me will flow,
Yet, just a smile form my Savior, I know,
Will through the ages be glory for me.
