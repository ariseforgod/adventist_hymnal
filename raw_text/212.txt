212 – 'Tis Almost Time for the Lord to Come


1
’Tis almost time for the Lord to come,
I hear the people say;
The stars of heaven are growing dim,
It must be the breaking of the day.

Refrain
O it must be the breaking of the day!
O it must be the breaking of the day!
The night is almost gone,
The day is coming on;
O it must be the breaking of the day!

2
The signs foretold in the sun and moon,
In earth and sea and sky,
Aloud proclaim to all mankind,
The coming of the Master draweth nigh.

3
It must be time for the waiting church
To cast her pride away,
With girded loins and burning lamps,
To look for the breaking of the day.

4
Go quickly out in the streets and lanes
And in the broad highway,
And call the maimed, the halt, and blind,
To be ready for the breaking of the day.
