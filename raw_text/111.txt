111 – It Took a Miracle


1
My Father is omnipotent
And that you can’t deny;
A God of might and miracles;
‘Tis written in the sky.

Refrain
It took a miracle to put the stars in place;
It took a miracle to hang the world in space.
But when He saved my soul,
Cleansed and made me whole,
It took a miracle of love and grace!

2
Though here His glory has been shown,
We still can’t fully see
The wonders of His might, His throne;
‘Till eternity.

3
The Bible tells us of His power
And wisdom all way through;
And every little bird and flower
Are testimonies, too.
