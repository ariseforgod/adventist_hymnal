When Christ Was Lifted From the Earth


[Verse 1]
When Christ was lifted from the earth His arms stretched out above
Through every culture, every birth, to draw an answering love.

[Verse 2]
Still east and west His love extends and always, near or far,
He calls and claims us as His friends and loves us as we are.

[Verse 3]
Where generation, class, or race divides us to our shame,
He sees not labels but a face, a person and a name.

[Verse 4]
Thus freely loved, tho’ fully known, may I in Christ be free
To welcome and accept His own as Christ accepted me.
