Dear Lord, We Come at Set of Sun


[Verse 1]
Dear Lord, we come at set of sun,
And at Your feet we kneel
To worship You, Creator, King,
This day, Your sign and seal.

[Verse 2]
Our earthly tasks we lay aside,
According to Your Word,
To enter now Your holy rest,
The Sabbath of the Lord.

[Verse 3]
Sweet Sabbath rest, your sacred hours
Are as a golden chain
That reaches back to Eden’s gate
And points us home again.

[Verse 4]
And when this earth shall be renewed,
And sin and death destroyed,
Shall all redeemed each Sabbath day
Still meet to praise their God.
