523 – My Faith Has Found a Resting Place


1
My faith has found a resting place,
Not in a manmade creed;
I trust the ever living One,
That He for me shall plead.

Refrain
I need no other evidence,
I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
And rose again for me.

2
Enough for me that Jesus saves,
This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul, I come to Him,
He will not cast me out.

3
My soul is resting on the Word,
The living Word of God,
Salvation in my Savior’s name,
Salvation through His blood.

4
My great Physician heals the sick,
The lost He came to save;
For me His precious blood He shed,
For me His life He gave.
