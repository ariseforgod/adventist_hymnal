Hymnal:463


[Verse 1]
Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

[Verse 2]
Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
To do the will of Jesus: this is rest.

[Verse 3]
Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
In Jesus’ keeping we are safe, and they.

[Verse 4]
Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
