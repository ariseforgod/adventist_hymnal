Hymnal:250


[Verse 1]
O for a thousand tongues to sing
my great Redeemer’s praise,
the glories of my God and King,
the triumphs of his grace!

[Verse 2]
My gracious Master and my God,
assist me to proclaim,
to spread through all the earth abroad
the honours of thy name.

[Verse 3]
Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
that bids our sorrows cease;
’tis music in the sinner’s ears,
’tis life, and health, and peace.

[Verse 4]
He breaks the power of canceled sin,
he sets the prisoner free;
his blood can make the foulest clean;
his blood availed for me.

[Verse 5]
He speaks, and listening to his voice,
new life the dead receive;
the mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
the humble poor believe.

[Verse 6]
Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
your loosened tongues employ;
ye blind, behold your saviour come,
and leap, ye lame, for joy.
