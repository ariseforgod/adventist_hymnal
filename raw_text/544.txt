[Verse 1]
Jesus, Son of blessed Mary,
Once on earth a little child,
Pattern fair of holy living,
Gracious, loving, undefiled;

[Verse 2]
Though Thy eager heart was yearning
Heavy laden souls to free,
Yet Thou calledst little children
In their happiness to Thee.

[Verse 3]
Grant that we, like little children,
Free from pride and guile my be;
Cheerful, trusting, safe, protected
By the blessed Trinity.
