372 – How Beauteous Are Their Feet


1
How beauteous are their feet
Who stand on Zion’s hill;
Who bring salvation on their tongues,
And words of peace reveal!

2
How charming is their voice,
So sweet the tidings are:
“Zion, behold thy Savior King;
He reigns and triumphs here!”

3
How happy are our ears,
That hear the joyful sound
Which kings and prophets waited for,
And sought, but never found!

4
How blessed are our eyes,
That see this heavenly light;
Prophets and kings desired it long,
But died without the sight!

5
The watchmen join their voice,
And tuneful notes employ;
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
And deserts learn the joy.
