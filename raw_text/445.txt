445 – I'm But a Stranger Here


1
I’m but a stranger here,
Heav’n is my home;
Earth is a desert drear,
Heav’n is my home.
Danger and sorrow stand
Round me on every hand;
Heav’n is my fatherland,
Heav’n is my home.

2
What though the tempest rage,
Heav’n is my home;
Short is my pilgrimage,
Heav’n is my home;
And time’s wild wintry blast
Soon shall be over past;
I shall reach home at last,
Heav’n is my home.

3
There at my Savior’s side
Heav’n is my home;
I shall be glorified,
Heav’n is my home;
There are the good and blest,
Those I love most and best;
And there I, too, shall rest,
Heav’n is my home.
