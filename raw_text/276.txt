276 – Thanks to God


1
Thanks to God whose Word was spoken
In the deed that made the earth.
His the voice that called a nation;
His the fires that tried her worth.
God has spoken;
Praise Him For His open Word

2
Thanks to God whose Word incarnate
Glorified the flesh of man.
Deeds and words and death and rising
Tell the grace in heaven’s plan.
God has spoken;
Praise Him For His open Word

3
Thanks to God whose Word is answered
By the Spirit’s voice within.
Here we drink of joy unmeasured,
Life redeemed from death and sin.
God has spoken;
Praise Him For His open Word
