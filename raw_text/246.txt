Hymnal:246


[Verse 1]
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
That was slain.

[Chorus]
Glory, hallelujah!
Praise Him, hallelujah!
Glory, hallelujah!
To the Lamb!

[Verse 2]
Saviour, let Thy kingdom come!
Now the power of sin consume;
Bring Thy blest millennium,
Holy Lamb.

[Verse 3]
Thus may we
each moment feel,
Love Him, serve Him,
praise Him still,
Till we all on Zion’s hill
See the Lamb.
