114 – There's a Wideness


1
There’s a wideness, in God’s mercy,
like the wideness of the sea;
There is mercy, with the Savior,
Which is more than liberty.

2
There is welcome, for the sinner,
and more graces for the good;
There is mercy, with the Savior,
There is healing in His blood.

3
For the love of God is broader
Than the measure of man’s mind.
And the heart of the Eternal,
is most wonderfully kind.

4
If our love were but more simple,
We should take Him at His word;
And our lives would be all sunshine,
In the sweetness of our Lord.
