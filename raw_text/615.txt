Rise Up, O Church of God


Verse 1
Rise up, O men of God!
His kingdom tarries long.
Bring in the day of brotherhood
and end the night of wrong.

Verse 2
Let women all rise up!
Have done with lesser things.
Give heart and mind and soul and strength
to serve the King of kings.

Verse 3
Rise up, courageous youth!
The church for you doth wait,
her strength unequal to her task;
rise up, and make her great!

Verse 4
Lift high the cross of Christ!
Tread where his feet have trod.
Disciples of the Son of Man,
rise up, O church of God!
