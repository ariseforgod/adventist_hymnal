007 – The Lord in Zion Reigneth


1
The Lord in Zion reigneth, let all the world rejoice,
And come before His throne of grace with tuneful heart and voice;
The Lord in Zion reigneth, and there His praise shall ring,
To Him shall princes bend the knee and kings their glory bring.

2
The Lord in Zion reigneth, and who so great as He?
The depths of earth are in His hands; He rules the mighty sea.
O crown His Name with honor, and let His standard wave,
Till distant isles beyond the deep shall own His power to save.

3
The Lord in Zion reigneth, these hours to Him belong;
O enter now His temple gates, and fill His courts with song;
Beneath His royal banner let every creature fall,
Exalt the King of heaven and earth, and crown Him Lord of all.
