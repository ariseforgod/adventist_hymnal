Hymnal:399


[Verse 1]
Beneath the forms of outward rite
Thy supper, Lord, is spread
In every quiet upper room
Where fainting souls are fed.

[Verse 2]
The bread is always consecrate
Which men divide with men;
And every act of brotherhood
Repeats Thy feast again.

[Verse 3]
The blessed cup is only passed
True memory of Thee,
When life anew pours out its wine
With rich sufficiency.

[Verse 4]
O Master, through these symbols shared,
Thine own dear self impart,
That in our daily life may flame
The passion of Thy heart.
