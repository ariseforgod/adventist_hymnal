460 – As Water to the Thirsty


1
As water to the thirsty,
As beauty to the eyes,
As strength that follows weakness,
As truth instead of lies;
As song-time and springtime and summertime to be,
So is my Lord, my living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.

2
Like calm in place of clamor
Like peace that follows pain,
Like meeting after parting,
Like sunshine after rain;
Like moonlight and starlight and sunlight on the sea,
So is my Lord, my living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.

3
As sleep that follows fever,
As gold instead of grey,
As freedom after bondage,
As sunrise to the day;
As home to the trav’ler and all he longs to see,
So is my Lord, my living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.
