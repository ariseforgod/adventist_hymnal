Hymnal:205

[Verse 1]
The golden morning is fast approaching;
Jesus soon will come
To take his faithful and happy children
to their promised home

[Chorus]
O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
piercing thro’ this night of gloom!
O, see the gleams of the golden morning
that will burst the tomb.

[Verse 2]
The gospel summons will soon be carried
to the nations round;
The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry
and the trumpet sound.

[Verse 3]
Attended by all the shining angels,
Down the flaming sky
the Judge will come, and will take his people
where they will not die.

[Verse 4]
The lov’d of earth who have long been parted,
Meet in that glad day;
The tears of those who are broken hearted
shall be wiped away.
