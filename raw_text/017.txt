017 – Lord of All Being, Throned Afar


1
Lord of all being, throned afar,
Thy glory flames from sun and star;
Center and soul of every sphere
Yet to each loving heart how near!
Yet to each loving heart how near!

2
Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray
Shed on our path the glow of day;
Star of our hope, Thy softened light
Cheers the long watches of the night,
Cheers the long watches of the night.

3
Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn;
Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn;
Our rainbow arch, Thy mercy’s sign;
All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine,
All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.

4
Lord of all life, below, above
Whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,
Before Thy ever-blazing throne
We ask no luster of our own,
We ask no luster of our own.

5
Grant us Thy truth to make us free
And kindling hearts that burn for Thee;
Till all Thy living altars claim
One holy light, one heavenly flame!
One holy light, one heavenly flame.
