431 – Over Yonder


1
Come let us sing of homeland,
Down by the crystal sea;
Wonderful land where Jesus
Buildeth a mansion for me.

Refrain
Over yonder, down by the crystal sea,
down              by the crystal sea,
Over yonder, there’s where I long to be,
There’s            where I long to be,
No more sorrow, toil, grief, nor care,
In the homeland bright and fair,
Over, over there.
Over there.

2
Water of life there floweth,
Fruit in abundant store;
Citizens of that country
Hunger and thirst never more.

3
Come go with me to homeland,
Jesus invites you there;
Help spread the invitation,
Tell it to men everywhere.
