421 – For All the Saints


1
For all the saints
who from their labors rest,
Who thee by faith
before the world confessed.
Thy name, O Jesus,
be forever blest.
Alleluia!
Alleluia!

2
Thou wast their Rock,
their Fortress and their Might;
Thou, Lord, their captain
in the well-fought fight;
Thou, in the darkness drear,
their one true light.
Alleluia!
Alleluia!

3
O may Thy soldiers,
faithful, true, and bold,
Fight as the saints
who nobly fought of old,
And win with them
the victor’s crown of gold.
Alleluia!
Alleluia!

4
And when the strife is fierce,
the warfare long,
Steals on the ear
the distant triumph song,
And hearts are brave again,
and arms are strong.
Alleluia!
Alleluia!

5
From earth’s wide bounds,
from ocean’s farthest coast,
Thro’ gates of pearl
streams in the countless host,
Singing to Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost,
Alleluia!
Alleluia!
