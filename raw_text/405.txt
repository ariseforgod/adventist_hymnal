Hymnal:405

[Verse 1]
O God, unseen, yet ever near,
Reveal Thy presence now
While we in love that hath no fear,
Before Thy glory bow.

[Verse 2]
Here may Thy faithful people know
The blessings of Thy love,
The streams that thro’ the dessert flow,
The manna from above.

[Verse 3]
We come, obedient to Thy Word
To feast on heav’nly food,
Our meat, the body of our Lord,
Our drink, His precious blood.

[Verse 4]
Thus may we all Thy words obey,
For we, O God, are Thine,
